# gosalesforce
Golang Salesforce REST API library. This library is inspired by the excellent "Simple-Salesforce" Python library.
Currently only OAuth2 is supported and an interface{} object is returned to keep things simple.

The documentation can be found at the [Godoc page](http://godoc.org/github.com/tux0010/gosalesforce)
